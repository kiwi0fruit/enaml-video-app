# Enaml video app

Easy to install cross-platform python desktop application that captures video via OpenCV and displays it via LGPL [Qt for Python](https://www.qt.io/qt-for-python) (PySide2 Qt 5.11) GUI composed with [Enaml](https://github.com/nucleic/enaml) and built with [PyAppShare](https://github.com/kiwi0fruit/pyappshare) cookbook that uses [Miniconda](https://conda.io/docs/glossary.html#miniconda-glossary) ([download](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)).

It's an example app that mixes:

* OpenCV video processing,
* PySide2 Qt 5.11 cross-platform GUI,
* Writing desktop UI with Enaml that is neat and fast,
* Easy distributing and installing the app via PyAppShare cookbook that uses Miniconda.

(The video lags as it imitates processing each frame via generating random numbers.)
