# Enaml video app

Easy to install cross-platform python desktop application that captures and processes video via [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) and displays it via LGPL [Qt for Python](https://www.qt.io/qt-for-python) (PySide2 Qt 5.11) GUI composed with [Enaml](https://github.com/nucleic/enaml) and [PyQtGraph](http://pyqtgraph.org) widgets and distributed with [PyAppShare](https://github.com/kiwi0fruit/pyappshare) cookbook that uses [Miniconda](https://conda.io/docs/glossary.html#miniconda-glossary).

It's an example app that mixes:

* [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) video processing,
* [Qt for Python](https://www.qt.io/qt-for-python) cross-platform GUI (PySide2 Qt 5.11),
* Writing desktop UI with [Enaml](https://github.com/nucleic/enaml) that is neat and fast,
* Cross-platform app easy to distribute and install made via [PyAppShare](https://github.com/kiwi0fruit/pyappshare) cookbook that uses [Miniconda](https://conda.io/docs/glossary.html#miniconda-glossary) ([download](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)).

(The video lags as it imitates processing each frame via generating random numbers.)
